A corruption reporting app


## Getting Started

This project is a flutter corruption reporting app

## Technologies used in the project

- Flutter: Flutter is a cross-platform framework developed by Google for building mobile applications. It allows for the development of high-performance, visually appealing applications for both Android and iOS platforms using a single codebase.
- Firebase Database: Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform provided by Google. Firebase Database is a real-time NoSQL cloud database that allows you to store and sync data in real-time. It provides a scalable and reliable backend infrastructure for the app.
- Firebase Authentication: Firebase Authentication provides secure user authentication and authorization services for mobile and web applications. It allows users to sign up, sign in, and manage their accounts securely.
- Firebase Cloud Functions: Firebase Cloud Functions is a serverless compute platform that allows you to run custom backend code in response to events and triggers. It can be used for tasks such as data validation, processing, and sending notifications.
- Firebase Cloud Storage: Firebase Cloud Storage is a scalable and secure object storage service. It can be used to store and retrieve user-uploaded files, such as images or documents, securely and efficiently.
- Firebase Cloud Messaging: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform messaging solution that allows you to send push notifications to users. It enables you to engage and re-engage users by sending targeted messages.
- Geolocation: Geolocation is a technology that enables the identification of the real-world geographic location of a device or user. It can be used to track and display the user's current location or provide location-based features in the app.
- Push Notifications: Push notifications are messages that are sent from a server to an application on a user's device. They can be used to deliver important updates, alerts, or reminders to users even when the app is not actively being used.
- Auth0 : Auth0 is an authentication and authorization platform that provides a comprehensive solution for adding secure user authentication and authorization to applications. It offers features such as single sign-on (SSO), social login integration, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and user management.

### How to run the project

1. Install Flutter: First, make sure you have Flutter SDK installed on your system. You can download Flutter from the official Flutter website (https://flutter.dev). Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system.
2. Set up Flutter environment: After installing Flutter, you need to set up the necessary environment variables. Add the Flutter bin directory to your system's PATH variable.
3. Verify Flutter installation: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify that Flutter is properly installed: ```flutter doctor``` . The `flutter doctor` command checks for any missing dependencies and provides guidance on how to resolve them.
4. Clone the repository and open the project with vs code text editor and navigate to the root project directory using the terminal or command prompt:
5. Connect a device or start an emulator: Connect a physical device (e.g., Android or iOS device) to your computer using a USB cable, or start an emulator (e.g., Android Virtual Device) if you prefer to run the app on a virtual device.
6. Run the app: Use the following command to run your Flutter app: ```flutter run```. This command builds and deploys the app to the connected device or emulator. If multiple devices are connected, you can specify the target device with the `-d` flag followed by the device ID.  For example, to run the app on a specific Android device, you can use:  ```flutter run -d device_id```. Replace `device_id` with the ID of the target device (e.g., `flutter run -d 1234ABCD`).
7. Wait for the app to launch: The build process may take some time, especially on the first run. Once the build is complete, the app should launch on the connected device or emulator.

That's it! You have successfully run a Flutter project. Make sure to keep the terminal or command prompt open while testing and developing your app, as it provides useful logs and debugging information.
